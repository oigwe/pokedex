## The Ask

### Task
- You will create a single page React app that mimics a Pokedex
- You will use the Public Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co
- Your app may not use React Router or any external tools / libraries we haven't covered in class
- Your app must break down the app into smaller components AND associate styling CSS files for those smaller components


#### Features

##### Home

![alt-text](./pokedex/src/assets/photos/TaskGoal1.jpg)

- Header area with the Title, search bar etc
- Home will display master list of Pokemon:
  - Small Image
  - Name
  - Number represented like: # 001
- Hovering over each pokemon should do a highlight effect
- Clicking on the Pokemon should take you to that Pokemon's page
- You can get each image by:
  - https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/sun-moon/icon/{pokemon-name}.png
  - EG: https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/sun-moon/icon/bulbasaur.png
- You will generate this list of Pokemon using a very important concept called Pagination
  - API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?offset=0&limit=20
  - You may ONLY fetch 20 Pokemon at a time
  - You may NOT fetch all 800+ Pokemon at once
  - To load more, there must be a LOAD MORE button. Once the user clicks it, it should load the NEXT SEQUENCE of Pokemon  BELOW. Adding to the Master List.
  - If you want to go above and beyond but not needed for this lab:
    - You may implement infinite scroll loading like in Instagram
    - You may need the following information:
onScroll Event
window.innerHeight 
window.scrollY
document.body.scrollTop
Home - Search Active


As a User types in the search bar, you will give suggestions below the input field.
The suggestions will use the pkmn-list.js data. Which you will store locally. Please do not send an API request for this information.
This is very similiar to the Spotify Playlist Search Lab
Hovering over each name of the Pokemon should have a hover effect
Clicking on the Pokemon name should take you to that Pokemon's page
This search functionality needs to work on any page. HOME and PROFILE
Selected Pokemon's Profile Page


API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon-name}
Eg: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur
That API will return all the data that you need on this page
You will get the large Pokemon artwork from:
https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/bulbasaur.jpg
Clicking on the Home >> link should return you to the Home Page.
You will need to create a Type Component similar to the Tag Component in our Trello Board App.
This component will always have a particular backgroundColor for the particular type.
You will be doing something like the following:
<Type name='Grass' /> <Type name='Poison' />
We will leave you to find the colors for all the types LOL
There are a total of 18 types
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type
Clicking on the individual moves will open up the Active Move component
Active Move on Pokemon's Profile


API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/{move-name}/
Eg: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/razor-wind/
Clicking on an individual move should open up this box / modal centered on the page with a close button.
This box will display the following data from the API:
NAME
Type
Power
PP
This mode should darken the rest of the page
Clicking the close should return User to the regular profile
